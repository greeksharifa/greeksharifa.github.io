본 사이트와 동일한 템플릿을 사용하는 것은 아무 상관이 없으나, 같은 템플릿을 사용하고자 한다면 테마를 바꾸시기 바랍니다(그대로 사용하는 사이트가 있음을 확인함).

Using the same template as this site has nothing to do with it, but if you want to use the same template, change the theme(I chekced some pages are using  exactly same theme with this site).

# Codinfox-Lanyon

This is a jekyll template based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). See a live demo [here](http://codinfox.github.io).

**If you like this project, PLEASE give it a star.**

Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

All the configurations are inside either `_config.yml` or `_config.scss`. The options are fairly straightforward. 

The theme supports: 

1. Theme colors: you can choose your favorite theme color
2. Changable sidebar locations
3. Integration of FontAwesome, MathJax, Disqus and Google Analytics
4. and numerous improvements over original Lanyon
